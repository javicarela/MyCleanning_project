## Data Introduction 
-The README.txt is the  desciption about the  process of how publishers of this dataset


-This project we use  x_train.txt, x_test.txt, y_train.txt, y_test.txt, sub_train.txt and sub_test.txt, they can all be found  in URI HAR Dataset.


-In features.txt are the variable name, that corresponds to each column of x_train.txt and x_test.txtThe features.txt contains the correct variable name, which corresponds to each column of x_train.txt and x_test.txt.


-In activity_labels.txt are the desciptive names for each activity label, that corresponds to each number in the y_train.txt and y_test.txt.


## Project script
**1.** Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.


**2.** Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.


**3.** Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set


**4.**Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.


**5.** From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
